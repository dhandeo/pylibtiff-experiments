2010-06-14   0.3.5-numpy:
-------------------------
Pearu Peterson added numpy support: constructing bitarray from numpy
ndarray object, added bitarray methods .toarray(), .toword(index=0,bits=8),
and .fromword(word, bits=8). Implemented left and right shift operations.

2009-04-06   0.3.5:
-------------------
Fixed reference counts bugs.  Added possibility to slice assign to True
or False, e.g. a[::3] = True will set every third element to True


2009-01-15   0.3.4:
-------------------
Made C code less ambiguous, such that the package
compiles on Visual Studio, will all tests passing.


2008-12-14   0.3.3:
-------------------
Made changes to the C code to allow compilation with more compilers.
Compiles on Visual Studio, although there are still a few tests failing.


2008-10-19   0.3.2:
-------------------
Added sequential search method.  The special method __contains__ now
also takes advantage of the sequential search.


2008-10-12   0.3.1:
-------------------
Simplified state information for pickling.  Argument for count is now
optional, defaults to True.  Fixed typos.


2008-09-30   0.3.0:
-------------------
Fixed a severe bug for 64bit machines.  Implemented all methods in C,
improved tests.  Removed deprecated methods from01 and fromlist.


2008-09-23   0.2.5:
-------------------
Added section in README about prefix codes.  Implemented _multiply method
for faster __mul__ and __imul__.  Fixed some typos.


2008-09-22   0.2.4:
-------------------
Implemented encode and decode method (in C) for variable-length prefix
codes.  Added more examples, wrote README for the examples.
Added more tests, fixed some typos.


2008-09-16   0.2.3:
-------------------
Fixed a memory leak, implemented a number of methods in C.  These include
__getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, pop, remove, insert.  The methods
implemented on the Python level is very limit now.  Implemented bitwise
operations.


2008-09-09   0.2.2:
-------------------
Rewrote parts of the README, implemented memory efficient algorithm for the
reverse method.  Fixed typos, added a few tests, more C refactoring.


2008-09-07   0.2.1:
-------------------
Improved tests, in particular added checking for memory leaks.  Refactored
many things on the C level.  Implemented a few more methods.


2008-09-02   0.2.0:
-------------------
Added bit endianness property to the bitarray object, also added the
examples to the release package.


2008-08-17   0.1.0:
-------------------
First official release; put project to
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray/


May 2008:
---------
Wrote the initial code, and put it on my personal web-site:
